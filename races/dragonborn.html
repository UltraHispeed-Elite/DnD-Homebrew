                <p>
                    Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erct in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. <br>
                    The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching interbreeding have created more uniform appearance. <br>
                    Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. <br>
                    They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6 1/2 fet tall and weighing 300 poundsor more. <br>
                    Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. <br>
                    The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. <br>
                    These dragonborn often boast scales that more closly match those of hteir dragon ancestor-bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, sliver, brass, copper. or bronze.

                <h1>Self-Sufficient Clans</h1>

                <p>
                    To any dragonborn, the clan is more importan than life itself. <br>
                    Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. <br>
                    Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor demands maintaining the bounds of tha position. <br>
                    A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. <br>
                    Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. <br>
                    They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before hey give up on something. <br>
                    A dragonborn holds mastery of races who shar the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn. <br>
                    Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is someimes needed in difficult clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid fom oher races- or even from the gods.
