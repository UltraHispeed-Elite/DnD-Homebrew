            <p>Born of dragons, as theikr name proclaims, he dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. <br>
                 Shaped by draconic gods o the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of draongs and humanoids. <br>
                Some dragon are faithful servants to true dragons, others from the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p>

                    Kindoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammer in deep mines and blazing forges, <br>
                     a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hared of goblins and orcs- these common threads unite all dwarves.

                        Elves are a magical people of oherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. <br>
                        They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spies glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts though the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. <br>
                        Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of he world.

                            A consant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhodds where gnomes form heir close-knit communities. <br>
                            Louder sounds punctuate he hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise o triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. <br>
                            Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

                            <p>
                                Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parens: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition <br>
                                tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tases of the elves. <br>
                                Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. <br>
                                Other live with the elves, gowing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. <br>
                                Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.

                                    The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsers and clashing armies; <br>
                                    a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. <br>
                                    Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, ohers form nomadic bands that travel constantly, <br>
                                     lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and people. <br>
                                    But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon josling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver

                                        Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, <br>
                                        orcs and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the teror of civilized lands nearby. <br>
                                        When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. <br>
                                        Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc ribes, their human blood giving hem an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. <br>
                                        Som venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. <br>
                                        Many of might deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.

                                            In the reckonings of mose worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. <br>
                                            Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. <br>
                                            Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to he elder races, and that's why they build their mighy empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. <br>
                                            Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world.
